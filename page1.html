</div><div>3. On the mql5.com website, the "Signals" service is available only to registered users who agree to accept the requirements of the Agreement on using the "Signals" service on the MQL5.com website.
</div><div>4. Monitoring of trading results is a periodic collection of data on the status of the trading account and the buying / selling operations carried out on it, according to a trading strategy. The trader can trade either manually or automatically with the help of trading robots (expert advisors). Monitoring records the results of the negotiation and provides statistics to stakeholders, in the form of reports and graphs.
</div><div>5. Trading signal is an event that triggers a purchase or sale in the signal's trading account.
</div><div>6. Transmission of a trading signal is the sending to Subscribers of messages about the appearance of a trading signal.
</div><div>7. Subscription is an offer to the public to receive trading signals for a particular signal. Subscription is designed to copy Signal trading operations to the Subscriber's trading account. Each User independently makes the decision to subscribe to a particular Signal, and to do this, in monitoring, they are provided with the trading results of all available Signals. Only registered users of the MQL5.community can subscribe.
</div><div>8. Subscriber is a User who contracts to receive Trading Signals through the "Signals" service. For each trading account, only one Sign can be signed.
</div><div>9. A Subscription implies that the Subscriber is aware of all risks and assumes full responsibility for copying other people's trading operations into his own trading account. In addition, the Subscriber confirms that it has the right to carry out trading operations on the account on which it will execute the Trading Signals.
</div><div>10. It is assumed that the monthly return is variable, and may involve losses at some point.</div><div>11. The minimal deposit or balance on MICRO or ZERO MICRO account is <strong>$25.00</strong>.</div><div>12. The minimal deposit or balance on STANDARD or ZERO STANDARD account is <strong>$250.00</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>II. Signing Signals
</strong></div><div>1. Sign subscription is available to all users who have an account on the MQL5.com website.
</div><div>2. To sign the FOREX ADVISOR 38 Sign, on the MQL5.community Payment System account, it will be necessary to have sufficient funds to cover the subscription fee for the selected period.
</div><div>3. Subscription can only be done from the MetaTrader platform. To copy the signals, the subscriber's trading platform must be constantly connected to the server through the account where the signals are subscribed. The platform receives the signals from the transactions, executed in the FOREX ADVISOR 38 account, and automatically copies them in the subscriber's account, only if it is connected to the server.
</div><div>4. Signal subscription is only available for MetaTrader 5 platform account;
</div><div>5. It is recommended that the Subscriber open an account at XM GLOBAL (open here), to minimize the risk of not being able to execute the buy / sell orders, based on the trading signals
</div><div>6. To complete the Subscription, you must accept the Signals Terms of Service and allow the execution of trading operations, based on the Trading Signals, in the MetaTrader client terminal settings.
</div><div>7. All Subscription parameters must be specified, in the settings of the MetaTrader terminal:
</div><div> permission to copy Stop Loss and Take Profit levels,
</div><div> percentage of funds, in the trading account, which can be used to execute buy / sell orders, based on the trading volumes of the Signal Source,
</div><div> allowed difference (between the execution price and the price of the copied transaction, in the Signal Source) in which the trading signals will be executed,
</div><div> minimum amount of own funds, in the trading account, which, once reached, interrupts the execution of trading signals and closes all positions.
</div><div>8. In the terminal display, only Signals from real accounts are available. The trading account provided when performing the Subscription cannot be changed later. To use another trading account, a new subscription is required.
</div><div>9. It is possible to suspend the execution of trading operations, in the active Subscription, however, when doing this, the subscription will not be canceled and the value of the interruption period will not be refunded. The interruption period is not carried over to the next subscription period, that is, it will not be taken into account when subscribing for a new period.
</div><div>10. In the Subscriber's account, to start executing trading operations based on FOREX ADVISOR 38 trading signals, it is necessary to perform an initial synchronization.
</div><div>11. Synchronization may require Subscriber to make decisions when:
</div><div> in the Subscriber's trading account, there are pending orders;
</div><div> in the Subscriber's trading account, there are open positions that are not related to the trading signals of the selected Source;
</div><div> in the Signal Source trading account, there is an unconfirmed profit in open positions, which can lead to an adverse start of trading for the Subscriber, under the worst conditions.
</div><div>12. The attempt to synchronize the subscriber's trading account is performed periodically until it is successful.
</div><div>13. Subscriber may perform forced synchronization if he agrees to immediately start working with the Subscription, without waiting for more favorable conditions, to open positions based on the FA38's existing positions.
</div><div>14. After a synchronization is completed, it is recorded in the MetaTrader client terminal log.
</div><div>15. The execution of your own trading operations, in accounts with a signed signal, constitutes interference and can lead to unpredictable results.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>III. Payment
</strong></div><div>1. All payment calculations between the parties are carried out on the internal payment system of the MQL5.com website, hereinafter referred to as the Payment System. In the Payment System, after registering on the MQL5.com website, an account is automatically created for the user of the MQL5.community.
</div><div>2. In order to subscribe to FOREX ADVISOR 38, it is necessary to have, in the account, the amount required to cover the subscription payment.
</div><div>3. Money can be deposited into the built-in Payment System via Alipay, UnionPay, PayPal, ePayments and bank cards.
</div><div>4. The subscription payment is automatically deducted from the Subscriber's account, in advance, at once, for the entire subscription period, at the time of Subscription.
</div><div>5. If the tariff subscription is canceled by the Subscriber, the money paid for it will not be refunded.
</div><div>6. In the event that FOREX ADVISOR 38 waives the transmission of the signal, the reserved Subscriber's funds will not be transferred to the FOREX ADVISOR 38 account.
</div><div>7. Fraudulent activities and / or falsification of the completed trading results will cause, on the one hand, the blocking of the Provider's account and, on the other hand, the refund of subscriptions to customers.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>IV. Possible risks and exemption from liability
</strong></div><div>1. By signing a Signal, you unconditionally understand and accept all risks associated with copying trading transactions in your trading account:
</div><div> Any past success in trading FOREX ADVISOR 38 does not guarantee profit in the future.
</div><div> Execution / non-execution of Signals can lead to a discrepancy between your results and those of FOREX ADVISOR 38.
